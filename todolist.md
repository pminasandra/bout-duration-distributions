# To-Do list
- [ ] Markovised sequences in `survival.py`.
- [ ] Bootstrap sequences in `fitting.py`.
- [ ] Markovised sequences in `fitting.py`.
- [ ] Should we compare Markovised sequences statistically, or will
        visualisation be sufficient?
- [ ] Nemenman-Bialek Finite Size Correction in `persistence.py`
- [ ] Markovised sequences in `persistence.py`

## Done

- [x] script to gather data from various sources
- [x] code to parse data, convert to bouts
- [x] sanity check: are all behaviours represented in all individuals, in each species?
- [x] code to fit distributions to data, make plots
- [x] code to plot instantaneous survival rate (or behavioural inertia)
- [x] write docs about behavioural inertia
- [x] simulation to test if classifiers cause heavy-tailedness
- [x] write docs about simulations
- [x] discussions on how to proceed
- [x] graphics to more convincingly make these arguments
- [x] (?) simulation to show effect of biased behavioural proportions
- [x] (?) simulation/maths to show that this is not just effect of hierarchical organisation
